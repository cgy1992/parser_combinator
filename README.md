# parser combinator library

## Motivation

There is a boost::split the famous parser EDSL, but this is a LL parser, it is not possible to perform the analysis of the LR grammar.

In addition, it is too complicated To use easily.

Therefore, we decided to also serve the purpose of learning about LR parsing algorithm, and make your own.

## Sample

See [test.cpp](https://github.com/minamiyama1994/parser_combinator/blob/master/test.cpp)
